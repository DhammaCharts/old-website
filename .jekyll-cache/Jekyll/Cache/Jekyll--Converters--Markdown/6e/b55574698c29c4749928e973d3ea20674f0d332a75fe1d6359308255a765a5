I"<p>Major concepts of Early Buddhist Texts The four truths appear in many grammatical forms in the ancient Buddhist texts,[15] and they have both a symbolic and a propositional function.[16] Symbolically, they represent the awakening and liberation of the Buddha, and of the potential for his followers to reach the same spiritual experience as him.[17] As propositions, the Four Truths are a conceptual framework that appear in the Pali canon and early Hybrid Sanskrit Buddhist scriptures.[18] They are a part of the broader “network of teachings”[19] (the “dhamma matrix”),[20] which have to be taken together.[19] They provide a conceptual framework for introducing and explaining Buddhist thought, which has to be personally understood or “experienced”.[21][note 2]</p>
